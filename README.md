## Conclusions
- Review lending policies for grades B and C, particularly for loans with interest rates ranging between 10.5% to 15%.
- Implement stricter credit checks or offer lower loan amounts to reduce default rates for borrowers in sub-grades B3, B4, and B5."
- Borrowers with 10 years of experience show higher default rates. Reassess the creditworthiness of this demographic and prioritize more stable income verification.
- Implement stricter loan approval criteria for borrowers with annual incomes ranging between 0.4 to 0.6 million.
- To reduce default risk, offer smaller loans or shorter repayment terms to lower-income borrowers."
- Assign higher risk weights to renters when evaluating loan applications
- Offer specialized financial products for renters, such as lower interest rates for smaller loans to reduce the risk of default."
- High-risk purposes ""debt consolidation, small business loans"" implement stricter lending criteria
- Ex: Debt consolidation: Set Minimum credit score, and short tenure with a slightly high interest rate. Small Business loans: Collateral, - - Set minimum business operational history (Ex: 2 years), and strict income check."
- Flexible Repayment Plans with lower EMIs
- Interest Rate Adjustments Ex: Borrowers with credit scores 700+ get a rate reduction to <10.5% upon request.
- Use automated alerts to remind borrowers of upcoming payments to avoid repayment/late payments."
- Offer loans with a lower initial interest rate for borrowers in grades B and C, which gradually increases based on repayment performance.
- Provide interest rate reductions for B and C-grade borrowers who opt for shorter loan tenures."
- Increase the tenure based on income, credit score, and past loan repayment behavior with a lesser interest rate
